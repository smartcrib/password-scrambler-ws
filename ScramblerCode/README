This folder contains a selection of code as implemented in S-CRIB Scrambler.

It is not a whole project but includes all relevant code for processing API commands.

scrib.c - this is the main processing loop that accepts requests and decides what to do.
scramble.c - this code shows the main passwordScramble function
sha1.c - this file contains a low-level Scramble function with SHA1-HMAC

The files do not contain complete code as implemented in Scramble S-CRIB but all relevant 
functions have been simply copy-pasted and no alteration to the code has been made.
